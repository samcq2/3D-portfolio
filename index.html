        <h2>üìú About me</h2>
        <h2>Thank you for visiting my portfolio page ! <br /> My name is Samuel Clarke-Quy and i studied Physics with Particle Physics at 
          Queen Mary University of London. I am an aspiring software developer looking to achieve a role in software development, so i have
          developed this portfolio website to showcase my technical projects including both back-end and front-end development, along with some
          of my Data Science / Analytics projects. I am also currently working at Ten10 as a trainee technical consultant.

        <p>
           This will be a multipage portoflio website where hyperlinks to my technical projects will appear here.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          My main accomplishments so far include developing a full-stack booking page for Warwick Band Society, 
          which was used the whole of this year until the executives of the society decided to go back to doing it manually.
          This included an integrated admin page for the executives of the socities to book events, close the practice rooms and 
          give tokens to customer users to purchase practice room bookings.
        </p>
        <p>

          Another achievment was getting an offer from Ten10 to be trained as a technical consultant straight out of university,
           before I even graduated. The training taught me how to code in Java, JavaScript, use SQL and various other softwares to 
           test software including automated testing and testing with postman.
